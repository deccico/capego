00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,190
Clyde,get up here,hurry.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,940
what is that?

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,960
a toilet.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,130
that's right. It's a toilet,clyde.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,210
And where is the toilet
seat some it's up!

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,570
Because you left it up,again!

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,086
We have been through this
count less times,clyde.

21
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:06,710
okay,mom. Not in front of my friends.

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,270
no,not okay. You're
not getting the message.

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,540
What if I fell in.******

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,210
Put it down!

25
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,760
thank you.

26
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,130
dude,that sucks,clyde.

27
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,490
A mom shouldn't be able to put
rules on toilet time like that.

28
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,320
Toilet time is the last bastion
of american freedom.

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,950
your mom always like that,dude?

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,990
could you guys not say anything
about this at school please.

31
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,560
of course man,it's cool.

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,810
clyde! Clyde!

33
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,020
What I have told you
about pissing on the seat.

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,010
Clyde is like,okay mom not
to n. Front of my friends.

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,290
carmen,it was lame.

36
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:57,920
I know right. Women are jealous they
have to face outward to pee and crap.

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,840
wait you're suppose to
poop in a toilet facing out?

38
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,640
but I thought you sit
on the toilet this way

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,360
so you have the nice li little shelf
for your cc book and chocolate milk.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,510
You have the flusher here.

41
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,870
no?

42
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,360
Geez,that's embarrassing.

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,600
clyde,clyde!

44
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,820
- There you are.
- mom?

45
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
- clyde donovan you could home this instant.
- why?

46
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,800
what I have told but
putting the toilet seat down

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,430
after going to the bathroom?

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,040
mom,I'm in class.

49

**********clyde,

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,920
I was trying to get read aoer for
work. The toit let seat was up again.

51
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,890
betsy,come home it's not a big deal.

52
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,830
no,roger it's a disgusting habit.*****

53
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,940
If I sat down I would of gotten
toilet water on my vagina.

54
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,466
my grandmother C

55
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,510
clyde,you're coming home now

56
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,950
and putting the toilet
seat down,where it belongs.

57
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,350
Let's go!

58
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,190
dude,I'm telling it
was fricking hysterical.

59
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,510
Clyde had to get up
in the middle of class

60
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,700
and follow his mom home to
put the toilet seat down.

61
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,510
He was so embarrassed,dude,I
thought he was going to die.

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,130
I know,fat ass,I was. There.

63
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,900
his mom says,clyde you're a asshole
I have toilet water in my vajayjay.

64
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,510
you're putting in words.

65
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,840
It's not that funny.

66
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,820
it's the last area of american freedom.

67
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,280
don't you feel a little bad for clyde?

68
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,600
you should.

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,970
He shouldn't be screamed at for
something not that big of a deal at all.

70
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,410
- what's going on?
- they're trying to save clyde's mom.

71
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,720
- from what.
- they say clyde left the toilet seat up again.

72
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,470
hang in,there you're
going to be fine,okay.

73
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,900
Stay with me now.

74
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,200
- I'm sorry there is nothing we can do.
- *******

75
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
When she fell into
the toilet she flushed

76
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,850
and it is pulling out her in sides.

77
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,880
can't we disconnect the toilet.

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,340
*********

79
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,670
the change in pressure
will rip out her organs.

80
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,680
she's not going to die,is she?

81
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,670
why did you leave the
toilet seat up,son.

82
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,820
clyde,clyde.

83
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,370
******** I don't blame you for this.

84
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,460
We should have been harder on you all of
those times you left the toilet seat up.

85
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,890
mom,I'm sorry.

86
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,520
I don't have a lot of time,clyde.

87
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,430
Just please,put the seat down
from now on for your sister's sake.

88
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,790
Please,oh god. Please,let
me go. Let in go.

89
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,730

<i>*********</i>

93
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,160
I will always remember betsy donovan's
kind nature more than anything.

94
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,560
She always traited people
with dignity and respect.

95
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,450
What a tragedy she had
to leave us so soon.

96
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,190
I'm sure betsy is hoping her
death will help women every wear

97
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,200
to take a extra second to look
before they sit on a toilet.

98
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,750
would like toe say on
be half of the departed

99
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,100
it's not a woman's responsibility
to see the seat is down.

100
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,630
It's a man's responsibility
to put it down.

101
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,460
It's not that hard.

102
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,080
ya.

103
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,730
putting the toilet seat
down isn't that hard.

104
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,470
So,is it too much to
ask,women,to just look

105
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,600
and put it down before they go plopping
their butts blindly on the toilet bowl.

106
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,680
my god,people this is a funeral.

107
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,500
**********

108
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,920
There is a little boy who lost
his mother and won't see her again

109
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,580
because he couldn't take the six tenths
of a second to put the toilet seat down.

*************

113
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,030
hello,ma'am. We're the
toilet safety administration.

114
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,760
the what.

115
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,670
after the recent tragedy new safety regulations
make us check every toilet for security.

116
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,730
Can we come in?

117
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,070
sure.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,100
who is it?

119
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,350
it's the toilet safety administration,

120
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,180
they're going to do
something to the potty.

121
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,240
my potty. What are they
going to do about it?

122
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,210
that's my bathroom.

123
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,270
we need completely redo this.

124
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,310
You need the counter moved.

125
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,530
We will install the safety belt.

******

127
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,440
federal law requires all toilets to have
a safety harness so known can move in.

Everywhere he goes people are telling
him he has blood on his weiner.

huh-uh,go on.

135
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,560
we keep trying to tell him
maybe this isn't his fault.

136
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,600
Maybe the people who made the toilet
are to blame for what happened.

137
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,480
we are just wondering
if we can sue someone.

138
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,670
you can always sue somebody.

139
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,770
alright. See,clyde.

140
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,430
We want to help him sue who
ever invented the toilet.

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,910
It will take special protocol.

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,630
We will have to perform a suaunec.

223
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,560

246
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,570
it's okay,sir.

247
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,830
There is just one person viewing
the monitors in a discrete location.

248

249

exactly how long are
we going to sit around

250
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,180
as our freedoms are
stripped away one by one?

251
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,940
It's time for to us stand together

252
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,040
and say we want the
government out of our bathroom.

253
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,880
ya!

254
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,800
now,listen.

255
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,820
All we have to do is agree as a community
to all bolt our toilet seats down.

256
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,410
If they can't razor lower there is
zero chance of anyone falling. in.

257
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,720
if there is no toilet seat the
government can't maybe a toilet seat law.

258
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,510
hold on!

259
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,090
If the seat can't raise up
the men will pee all over it.

260
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,720
- no,we won't.
- ya,you will.

261
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,380
well,sorry,women have to deal with
a little splash of pee on the rim.

262
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,510
It's a far better solution then
the government in the bathrooms.

263
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:36,140
how about we agree to that if men
agree to always sit down to urinate.

264
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,830
no,you can't make men sit down to pee.

265
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,610
How can we play sink the boat?

266
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,940
how will nelson and I make
an x on sleepover nights.

267
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,880
what about us loggered,hard working men

268
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,230
who like to stand up and
take a pooh and turn around

269
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,010
and cut their pooh in
half with their you're in.

270
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,700
sorry ********

271
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,060
we may  have to give up
peeing our feces in half.

272
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,130
folks have been logging
here for generations.

action lawsuit tomorrow.

284
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,440
We need all of your friends and families

Shock and outrage after an unknown

with a gun and baby
leaving the toilet seat up.

why are we giving up freedom

baby and a gun on the toilet.

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,390
never.

318
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,700
quick everyone,get out all your money.

319
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,530
clyde. Clyde.

320
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,960
mom?

321
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,160
this lawyer is a fraud.

322
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,680
He has been swindling you and
your friends for your money.

323
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,900
It's a ghost.

324
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,420
you can't sue the dead,clyde.

325
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,230
Putting the toilet seat down
is a matter of simple etiquette.

326
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,360
It's common sense,clyde.

327
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,630
oh boy here we go.

328
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,230
don't try to blame
mommy's death on anything

329
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,300
but your failure to do something I
asked you time and time again to do.

330
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,430
It's your fault.

331
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,720
hold on just a second!

332
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,840
It's not anyone's fault.

333
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,390
I am sick and tired
of all of this nonsense

334
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,210
over my porcelain toilet machine.

335
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,580
there he is. sir john harrington.

336
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,770
quick sue him.

337
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,980
you can't sue me.

338
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,860
You're all using my toilet
invention the wrong way.

339
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,060
when you have to sit and
take a sir harrington,

340
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,520
you're suppose to face this way

341
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,870
so you can use the little shelf
for your books,quill and ink

342
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,410
I told you,you sit on
it that way. I told you.

343
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,770
why would I design it after
you take a sir harrington

344
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:29,309
you have to turn around and look
at your sir harrington to flush.

345
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,880
That's gross.

346
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,010
if you sit on it that way you
take your pants all the way off.

347
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,370
of course why do you think I designed
toilet rooms with a laundry hole.

348
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,790
that's what that hole is for?.

349
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,970
so,clyde's mom ghost is like,

350
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,800
clyde,what I have told
you clyde,you asshole.

351
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,014
***** Mom,stop,

352
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:05,318
dude,it was a riot.

353
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,240
that's not what I said.

354
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,750
ya,well. I'm just glad that
stupid tsa crap is over with.

355
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,970
I knew had you a tough week clyde.

356
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,940
At least your mom
didn't die for nothing.

357
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,078
**********

358
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,384
****

359
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:26,210
