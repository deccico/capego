00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:35,714
Throw it here!
Throw it here!

3
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:39,075
Yeah!
Nice one, Clyde!

4
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:39,809
Clyde!

5
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:41,161
Clyde!

6
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:43,497
Clyde, get up here!
Hurry!

7
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:50,142
What is that?

8
00:00:52,463 --> 00:00:53,054
A toilet.

9
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:56,096
That's right.
It's a toilet, Clyde.

10
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:58,085
And where is the toilet seat?

11
00:00:58,801 --> 00:00:59,887
It's up.

12
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,344
Because you left it up.
Again!

13
00:01:02,877 --> 00:01:06,582
We've been through this a countless times, Clyde.
Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?

14
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,169
No, not okay. Because you 
aren't getting the message!

15
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:11,705
What if I'd fallen in?
Start listening to me!

16
00:01:11,825 --> 00:01:13,668
Put it down!
Put it down!

17
00:01:17,226 --> 00:01:17,970
Thank you.

18
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:23,728
Dude, that sucks, Clyde.

19
00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:27,066
A mom shouldn't be able to put
rules on toilet-time like that.

20
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:29,841
Toilet-time is the last
bastion of American freedom.

21
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,365
Is your mom always like that, dude?

22
00:01:33,464 --> 00:01:34,235
Look, could you guys...

23
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:36,473
not say anything about
this in school, please?

24
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:38,869
Ofcourse man.
It's cool.

25
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:42,801
Clyde, Clyde!

26
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,979
What have I told you 
about pissing on the seat?

27
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:45,930
and Clyde's all like...

28
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,790
Okay mom, fuck! Not in 
front of my friends!

29
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:53,334
Cartman, it was actually really lame.

30
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:54,360
I know, right!

31
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:57,656
Women are just jealous 'cause they
have to face outwards to pee and crap.

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:01:59,943

39
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:17,868
Clyde!

40
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:19,675
Clyde!

41
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:21,846
Aah, there you are!

42
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,613
Mom?

43
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:25,145
Clyde Donovan, you come
home this instant!

44
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:25,886
Why?

45
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:28,360
What have I told you about...

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,329
putting the toiletseat down
after you go to the bathroom?

47
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,004
Mom, I'm in class.

48
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:33,754
How many times do I
have to tell you, Clyde?

49
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:36,825
I was trying to get ready for work
and the toilet seat was up, again.

50
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:39,818
Betsy, come back home,
it's just not that big a deal.

51
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:42,866
No, Roger. It's a disgusting habit 
and I'm sick and tired of it.

52
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:46,684
If I had sat down, I would have 
gotten toilet water all over my vagina.

53
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,711
My grandma is 
from Virginia.

54
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,755
You're coming home right now, and
you're putting the seat where it belongs.

55
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:06,821
Dude, I'm telling you it
was freaking hysterical.

56
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:12,606
Clyde had to get up in middle of class and
follow his mom home to put the seat down.

57
00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:15,287
He was so embarrassed, dude, I 
thought he was gonna die.

58
00:03:16,498 --> 00:03:17,903
I know, fat-ass.
I was there.

59
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:19,520
His mom...

60
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,251
His mom goes

61
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:23,822
Clyde, you're an asshole and now
I have toilet water in my vagigi.

62
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:26,494
That's not what she said.
You're putting extra's on it again.

63
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:27,640
It's not that funny.

64
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:30,830
I know dude. The bathroom is the
last bastion of American freedoom.

65
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,333
Don't you feel just a
little bad for Clyde?

66
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:35,928
Uh uh.

67
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:37,390
Well you should.

68
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:41,363
The poor guy shouldn't be screamed at
for something that isn't that big a deal at all.

69
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,070
What's going on?

70
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,158
They're trying to save Clydes mom.
From what?

71
00:03:52,278 --> 00:03:54,847
They're saying Clyde left
the toilet seat up again.

72
00:03:57,602 --> 00:04:00,405
Hang in there. You're going to
be fine okay? Stay with me now.

73
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:03,078
I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.
What?!

74
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:05,914
When she fell into the toilet,
she also made it flush.

75
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:08,847
It created a suction that's literally
pulling out her insides.

76
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:11,006
Can't we disconnect the
toilet from the plumbing?

77
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,052
Yes, we'll have to, but

78
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:15,692
when we do that the change in 
pressure will rip out her organs.

79
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:17,975
But she's not going to die, is she?

80
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:20,980
Why did you leave the
toilet seat up, son?

81
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:22,385
Clyde!

82
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:23,279
Clyde!

83
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:25,006
Clyde!

84
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:27,967
I want you to know that I
don't blame you for this.

85
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:29,903
We should've been

86
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:33,834
harder on you all those times
you left the toilet seat up.

87
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,620
Mom, I'm sorry.

88
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:37,551
I...don't...

89
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,011
have a lot of time, Clyde.

90
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:40,983
Just...

91
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:41,715
please...

92
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:44,428
put the seat down
from now on.

93
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:46,829
for your sisters sake, please.

94
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,566
Oh, God, please let me go.
Let me go.

95
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,710
Do it! Do it! Do it!

96
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,640
Mom?

97
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:13,739
I'll always remember Betsy Donovans 
kind nature, more then anything.

98
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,337
She always treated people
with dignity and respect.

99
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,097
What a tradegy she had 
to leave us so soon.

100
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,028
But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that 
her dead will help women everywhere

101
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,949
just take that extra second to
look before they sit on a toilet.

102
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,735
I'd like to say on 
behalf of the departed, that

103
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:36,068
it isn't a womens responsibility
to see that the seat is down.

104
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:38,627
It's a mens responsibility
to put it down.

105
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:39,840
It's not that hard.

106
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,374
Yeah, yes. That's right.

107
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,380
Putting the toilet seat 
down isn't that hard.

108
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:52,219
So is it too much too 
ask women to just look?

109
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:56,815
And put it down before they go plopping
their butts blindly to the toilet bowl?

110
00:05:57,004 --> 00:06:00,253
My God, people. This is a funeral!
Please have some respect!

111
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:02,996
There is a little boy here
who has lost his mother!

112
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:04,732
He'll never see her again!

113
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:09,599
Because he couldn't take that sixth-
tenth of a second to put the seat down

114
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,194
when he was done peeing.

115
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:13,582
And now little Clyde's mother is dead.

116
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,743
And the blood is on his penis.

117
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,067
It's too bad we didn't find any 
treasure on the subway, Phillip.

118
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:29,056
Hi Ugly Bob. Hi Terrance, hi Phillip.
Mom, get the door!

119
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:30,968
You're looking hideously
ugly today, Ugly Bob.

120
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:33,478
How come you guys sayt stuff like that?
Because you're goddamn ugly...

121
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:36,952
Hello mam, we're the toilet
safety administration.

122
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:37,791
The what?

123
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:42,612
After the recent tragedy, new safety
regulations require us to check all toilets.

124
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,623
Can we come in?
Sure.

125
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:46,983
Who are these buttholes?

126
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:49,360
It's the toilet
safety administration, hun.

127
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,138
They're going to do
something to the potty.

128
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:52,925
My potty? What are 
they going to do to it?

129
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:55,950
He, he!
That's my bathroom.

130
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:00,094
Oh yeah, we're going to have
to completely redo this mam.

131
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,360
You need to have this counter
moved a minimum of six inches

132
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,559
But we'll go ahead and install
your safety belt. --Safety belt?

133
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:11,296
Federal law requires all toilets to be
fitted with a harnes so nobody can fall in.

134
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:13,648
Dude, you can't make me wear
a seatbelt to take a dump.

135
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:16,698
This is for your safety.
A woman died, you know.

136
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:19,175
Yeah, but the bloods on
Clyde's weiner, not mine.

137
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:24,934
Sir, we are really worried
about our friend Clyde.

138
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,597
Everywhere he goes people
are telling him he has blood

139
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:29,043
on his weiner.

140
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,389
Uh-uh, go on.

141
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:33,447
We keep trying to tell him
maybe this all isn't his fault.

142
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:36,463
Maybe the people who made the toilet
are to blame for what happened.

143
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:37,856
So we were just wondering...

144
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:39,169
if we could sue somebody.

145
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,485
You can always sue somebody.

146
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,221
All right, you see, Clyde.

147
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:47,396
Okay, we wanna help him sue
whoever invented the toilet.

148
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,102
You got it.

149
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:52,484
Here we go,
the inventor of the toilet.

150
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:54,537
Sir Thomas Harrington.

151
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:57,479
In England, died in 1692.

152
00:07:59,166 --> 00:07:59,955
Aw, he's dead?

153
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,001
So, then we can't sue him?

154
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:03,372
Why not? You can
always sue somebody.

155
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:05,790
Just going to take
some special protocol.

156
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:07,502
We would have to perform...

157
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:09,214
a suance.

158
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,649
A...a...a...a...

159
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:15,422
suance?

160
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:17,666
You bet.

161
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:20,916
Here at Hoffman and Turk we
specialize in suing the dead.

162
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:22,765
If you hire us,
we'll work hard...

163
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:23,438
for you.

164
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:24,490
Wow, really?!

165
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:25,753
You hear that, Clyde?

166
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:27,872
Now look,

167
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:31,853
I'll be asking all of you
to have a very open mind

168
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:34,321
and a willingness to
face your fears.

169
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:36,498
I warn you boys.

170
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:38,978
A suance can be very...

171
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:39,967
expensive.

172
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:41,662
How expensive?

173
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,092
How much do you have?

174
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:45,859
Clyde got $3000 from
his moms life insurrance.

175
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:46,771
Wow!

176
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,303
That's exactly how
much a suance costs.

177
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:56,441
Wow, that's weird.

178
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:09,581
Damn it!

179
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:14,792
He, he, officer.

180
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:18,074
If you're sitting on the toilet you
need to wear your safety belt, sir.

181
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:19,953
Yeah, I know, I had it on.

182
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,587
I just took it of for a second
to get the uh... to get...

183
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:26,003
The address here is 260
avenue de los Mexicanos?

184
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,245
Ooh, come on, don't
give me a ticket!

185
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:30,813
Got to wear the safety belt
or you could fall in.

186
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:33,389
I'm nog going to fall in.
I'm not a chick.

187
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,708
The law is the law, sir.

188
00:09:35,828 --> 00:09:38,513
You can pay this by
mail or appear in court on that date.

189
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:41,048
Have a good day, sir.
Yeah, thanks.

190
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,103
Asshole.

191
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:43,253
You say something?

192
00:09:43,445 --> 00:09:45,555
No, I was talking
to my asshole.

193
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:48,024
Come on, asshole.
Let get back to work.

194
00:09:54,016 --> 00:09:55,744
This is unbelievable.

195
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,838
Stupid toilet
safety administration.

196
00:09:58,038 --> 00:10:01,009
You can't even take a crap at IHOP
without a fourty-minute line!

197
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:06,161
Shoes off, belts off!
Sharp objects go in the plastic tray!

198
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:07,715
This is inhumane.

199
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:08,646
Shut up!

200
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:09,842
Sir.

201
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:12,851
Taking a dump today, mam?

202
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:14,862
No, just need to pee.

203
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:18,144
I'll just need to check
inside your asshole.

204
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,554
Hee, how about you people
speed it up in here?

205
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:23,679
I'm about to crap my pants and
I demand access to the toilets

206
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,593
right now!

207
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:27,279
Do you mind if I toch 
your balls, sir?

208
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,525
What? Yes I'd mind!

209
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:30,979
Do you mind if I touch 
your fucking balls?

210
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:33,527
Okay, I'm done.

211
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:37,317
Right, sir. I just need to
check inside your asshole.

212
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,631
I don't need you wiping my ass 
for me. I am a grown man.

213
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,323
Yes, you're a big boy, aren't you, sir?

214
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,105
Yeah, I'm a big boy.

215
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:46,983
That's a big boy, sir.

216
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:48,512
I'm a big boy.

217
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:50,099
I took a big boy poop.

218
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:51,318
Yes.

219
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:55,174
Alright boys, sit down
and clear your minds.

220
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:57,202
The suance is 
about to begin.

221
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:00,443
Doors and windows are locked.
You boys have your $500 in cash ready?

222
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:01,746
Yeah.

223
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:06,150
Alright. Then I've got this big bowl set
here, to catch all money were about to make.

224
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,034
Now. Let us start.

225
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:11,683
We call out to the
land of the dead.

226
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:16,304
Sir John Harrington
Your presence is requested.

227
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:19,686
Appear to us, John Harrington.

228
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,512
We have a subpoena.

229
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,229
Jeez, it's not working.

230
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,415
John Harrington.

231
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:30,121
My client is due
compensation for negligence.

232
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:37,143
What is your name, spirit?

233
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,223
Burns.

234
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,051
Jimmy Burns.
What's it to you?

235
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:41,287
Who are you, mugs?

236
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:43,307
That's how people
talked in the past.

237
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:48,077
We have a claim against a John
Harrington. Do you know him spirit?

239
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,703
Well, maybe I do 
and maybe I don't.

240
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,769
Might need a little something
something to jar my memory.

241
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,395
We got to grease him.
Put a hundred in the box.

242
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,701
Oh yeah, Harrington. 
I know him.

243
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,410
Always going round
inventing things.

244
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,833
Yes, that's him. Is his 
personage amongst you?

245
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:10,692
Well, maybe it is
and maybe it isn't.

246
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:11,689
Give him another hundred.

247
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:16,794
Yeah, I've seen
him around, alright.

248
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:20,965
He was just down that way. Bragging
about some porcelain machine.

249
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:23,131
No!

250
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:24,968
No!

251
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:26,937
By the power of Christ,
we sue you.

252
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:28,865
By the power of Christ,
we sue you.

253
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:31,602
You can't sue me!

254
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:35,059
Quick, put the other
$300 in the box!

255
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,201
This actualy went really, really well.

256
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:46,718
Always happens some burocrate tries
to block the first sue ons attempt.

257
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,298
But this was good.
We'll get him tomorrow.

258
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,080
So, that's it?

259
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:51,569
Yeah, were going to need 
about 400 more dollars tomorrow.

260
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,663
I know you're sad about your mom, Clyde.
But don't worry. We're going to win this thing.

261
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:06,346
Put your coffee in the 
plastic tray, please, sir.

262
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:08,242
Shoes off. Belts off.

263
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:09,390
Yeah, yeah.

264
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:11,865
Got any metal
in your pockets?

265
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:14,659
I just need to 
check your asshole.

266
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,888
So ridiculous.

267
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:19,208
Asshole clear.

268
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:20,226
Thanks.

269
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,180
Pick your coffee up, sir.

270
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:27,307
Anyways, he says i'm getting
nothing anyway, so you can...

271
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:29,012
Hee, what's that thing?

272
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:33,328
That's a camera.
It's a security camera.

273
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:35,513
You people have me on camera now?

274
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:38,157
It's okay sir. There's
just one person

275
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:41,667
viewing the monitors 
in a discrete location.

276
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:47,757
How long are we
going to sit around

277
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:50,369
while our freedoms are
stripped away one by one.

278
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:54,851
Time for us to stand together and say,
we want the goverment out of our bathrooms.

279
00:13:57,976 --> 00:13:58,375
Now listen.

280
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:01,344
All we have to do is 
agree as a community

281
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:03,880
to all bolt our
toilet seats down.

282
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,248
If they can't raise or lower,
there's zero change of anyone falling in.

283
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,635
If there's no toilet seats, the
goverment can't make toilet seat laws.

284
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:16,570
No, no. hold on.

285
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,780
If the seat can't raise up the
men will just pee all over it.

286
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,685
No, we won't.

287
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:23,356
Yeah, you will.

288
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:27,540
Well, sorry if women might have to deal
with a little splash of pee on the rimm.

289
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,446
But its a far beter solution then 
having the goverment in our batrooms, right?

290
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,919
How about we agree 
to <i>that</i>, if...

291
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,087
men will agree that they will
always sit down to urinate.

292
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,832
Well, no, you can't make
men sit down to pee.

293
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:40,620
How could we play
sink the boat?

294
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,932
Yeah, how will Nelson and I 
make an X on sleepover nights?

295
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:45,751
What about us loggers?

296
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:49,390
Hardworking men who like to stand up
after they have taken a poo

297
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,951
and then turn around and cut 
their poo in half with their urine?

298
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:58,689
Sorry, but if we don't want the
goverment treating us like children,

299
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:01,934
we might have to give up being
able to pee our feces in half.

300
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:05,002
But folks been logging round
these parts for generations.

301
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:08,844
My papy taught me logging.
And his papy before him.

302
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:11,704
Yeah, I think we just
got to live with the TSA.

303
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:13,422
Yeah, yeah.

305
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:22,260
Merciful summary on 
behalf of the plaintive?

306
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:24,577
What's happening now?

307
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:27,341
Our motion has been
denied by the judge.

308
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:28,885
Concentrate boys!

309
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:35,052
This Spectre is like none
I have ever encountered.

310
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:38,455
He managed to avert liability
within injunction against our claim.

311
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:39,741
So, what does that mean?

312
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:42,624
We'll hit him with a 
class-action lawsuit tomorrow.

313
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:46,317
We'll need all your friends and family
to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each.

314
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:47,047
What?!

315
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:51,656
Hang in there, Clyde. This is all
to make the world a safer place.

316
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,701
Security breach!

317
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:35,851
An embarrassing day for the
toilets safety administration.

318
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:39,387
Shocking outrage ensued
after an unknown terrorist

319
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:43,129
managed to get through TSA 
security with a gun and a baby.

320
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:45,146
Leaving the toilet seat up.

321
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:48,987
The head of TSA chief of
operations had this to say;

322
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:50,921
Shit!

323
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:55,677
Meanwhile, outraged civilians 
claiming they're finally fed up

324
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:58,117
with the overblown 
goverment bureaucracy.

325
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,321
What good is the TSA if
they're not protecting us?

326
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:04,921
Why have we given up freedom if terrorists 
can take a hostage in a bathroom...

327
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,344
with a baby and a gun
on the toilet?

328
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:08,722
And the toilet seat was up.

329
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:12,735
We've all stood by as mother 
goverment is taking our dignity.

330
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:13,573
That's right!

331
00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:17,432
Now it is time to take 
responsibility for ourselves.

332
00:18:18,486 --> 00:18:21,315
It is time for all
of us to grow up.

333
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,185
That's right.

334
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:23,637
It is time

335
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:25,427
for a suance.

336
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,368
Wait, what?

337
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,336
What the fuck
is a suance?

338
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,556
Tom, I'm standing outside
the South Park courthouse

339
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:35,643
where experts have succesfully
summoned the ghost

340
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:38,357
of toilet inventor
sir John Harrington.

341
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:41,328
Now that the spirit has
crossed over from the dead.

342
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:43,519
lawyers are going to 
try and sue him.

343
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:48,581
Sir Thomas Harrington, your extreme 
negliglence has cost tax payers millions.

344
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,556
No!

345
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:52,306
No!

346
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:56,381
You will be sooth, spirtit.
Thy liability is without question.

347
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:01,381
Appear before this
court, Harrington.

349
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:03,322
Never!

350
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,338
Quick, everyone, get
out all your money.

351
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:14,629
Clyde?

352
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:16,837
Clyde?

353
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:18,355
Mom?

354
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:21,062
This lawyer is a fraud.

355
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:25,112
He has been swindeling you and 
your friends for your money.

356
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:29,311
Fuck me, it's a ghost.
You can't sue the dead, Clyde.

357
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:33,212
Putting the toilet seat down
is a matter of simple etiquette.

358
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:35,146
It's common sense, Clyde.

359
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:36,548
Oh boy, here we go.

360
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:40,461
Don't try and blame mommies death
on anything but your faillure.

361
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:43,374
to do something I have asked
you time and time again to do.

362
00:19:43,494 --> 00:19:45,009
It's your fault.

363
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:47,640
Now hold on just a second!

364
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:47,821
It's not anyone's fault.

366
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,933
I'am sick and tired of all this nonsense
over my porcelain toilet machine.

367
00:19:57,582 --> 00:20:00,611
There he is.
Sir John Harrington.

368
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:03,939
Quick, sue him!
You can't sue me.

369
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:07,931
You're all using my toilet
invention the wrong way.

370
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:12,089
When you have to sit and
take a sir Harrington...

371
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:14,493
you're suppoosed to
be facing this way.

372
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,846
So you can use the little shelf for
your books, and your quill and your ink.

373
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,626
Aha!

374
00:20:18,746 --> 00:20:21,455
I told you you should sit
on it that way! I told you!

375
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:24,948
Why would I design it so that when
you're finished taking a sir Harrington

376
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:29,446
you have to stand up, turn around a look
right down at your Harrington to flush.

377
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:30,965
That's gross.

378
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:33,392
Yes, but...

379
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,995
But if you sit on it that way, you have
to take your pants all the way off.

380
00:20:37,115 --> 00:20:41,289
Why do you think I designed
toilet rooms with a laundry hole?

382
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,776
That's what that
hole is for?

383
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:50,487
Oops.

384
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,293
So then... so then Clydes
moms ghost was all like

385
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:59,530
Clyde, what have I told
you Clyde, you asshole!

386
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,067
And Clyde is all like

387
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:03,821
Mom leave me alone! 
I'm seriously. Stop, please!

388
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:05,167
Dude, it was a riot.

389
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:08,071
That's not what I said.

390
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,348
Yeah, well...

391
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,803
I'm just glad that
stupid TSA crap is over.

392
00:21:11,923 --> 00:21:14,865
I know you've had a tough week, Clyde.
But at least your mom didn't die for nothing.

393
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:15,548
I mean...

394
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:18,171
We're kinda right back at to the bathroom
being the last bastion of American freedom

395
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,127
so, technically your mom
did die for nothing, but...

396
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:21,541
Clyde?

397
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:23,222
Clyde?

398
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:24,462
Clyde, you there?

399
00:21:24,853 --> 00:21:25,336
Hello?

400
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:45,669
