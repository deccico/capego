3
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:41,060
Yes, yes, this whole coming week

4
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:43,100
is the Jewish holiday of passover!

5
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:45,179
Yes, it's all about how Moses

6
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,755
led the hebrews out of Egypt.

7
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:47,607
Very good!

8
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,234
So on Friday, all Jewish people

9
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:52,944
will celebrate passover with a seder dinner.

10
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:54,944
Because God commanded the Jews

11
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:56,090
to only eat bread that

12
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:57,778
hasn't been given yeast to rise.

13
00:00:58,585 --> 00:00:59,615
Wow, that's so cool.

14
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:02,118
And so then passover lasts seven days?

15
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:05,131
Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday

16
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,222
to the next Friday...

17
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,653
Interesting, and why is it called
passover again?

18
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:10,436
Well, because in ancient Egypt

19
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,906
God passed over the houses

20
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:13,868
marked with the blood of a lamb.

21
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:15,905
So interesting, wow...

22
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:17,873
Get outta here!

23
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:19,591
Oh, hey, Kyle.

24
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,866
Get outta here!

25
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:22,198
Well, I better be going.

26
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:24,148
Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.

27
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:25,574
Well, you're very welcome.

28
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:27,617
What are you gonna do?

29
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:29,311
Isn't it possible I just want to

30
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:30,589
learn more aut the Jewish faith?

31
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:32,080
No.

32
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,444
Alright Kyle, listen-

33
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:38,330
legends tell of a horrific four

34
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,805
legged creature from Mexico

35
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:41,082
that sucks the blood of goats

36
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:43,205
and it might have just spotted in South Park.

37
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:44,967
What does that have to do with passover?

38
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,749
All I can promise you is

39
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:49,543
that this is gonna be the most memorable
passover ever.

40
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:52,891
Cartman's passover holiday special.

41
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:54,053
Starring...

42
00:01:58,404 --> 00:02:00,093
The Jewpacabra!!!!!

43
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:14,256
Alright, next please.

44
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:15,749
Signing up for the easter egg hunt?

45
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:17,122
Ooh da lolly!

46
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,649
This is gonna be so much fun!

47
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:20,372
Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday.

48
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:21,374
Woohoo. Me too!

49
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:23,022
Yeah.. Yeah should be a real blast.

50
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,308
I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up...

51
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:25,993
That's all.

52
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:28,982
Jewpa-what?

53
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,228
Jewpaca- look, it's nothing.

54
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:31,161
Forget I said anything.

55
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:32,062
Okay.

56
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:34,239
So anyways, are they saying
what time the event starts?

57
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,619
Okay, look - a lot of people

58
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,924
claim that on passover,

59
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:38,983
a blood sucking creature called
the Jewpacabra comes out

60
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:39,935
and preys on children.

61
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:43,041
This year passover happens to be
the same week as easter.

62
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:45,924
You mean it's like - like a monster?

63
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:47,310
It's just a legend, alright?!

64
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,698
But people all over town have

65
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,145
started reported strange things.

66
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,627
Knocked over trash cans... weird howls...

67
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:54,487
Yeah, huh, token!

68
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:55,548
Don't think it won't come after

69
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:56,624
you just because you're black!

70
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,295
U guys, check this out!!!

71
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:02,274
Alright, alright, stay back -

72
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:02,949
stay back.

73
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,518
It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,403
but it's hard to tell.

75
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,761
Alright guys, we're gonna need
some video cameras.

76
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:10,623
We gotta go out at night

77
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:11,655
and try to get proof of this thing.

78
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:12,821
Alright, alright!

79
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,709
Knock it off!

80
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:15,123
Stop spreading lies!

81
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:16,744
I'm trying to protect people!

82
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:17,887
And why are you so quick to try

83
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,408
and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?

84
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:21,461
I looked on the known species webpage

85
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:22,551
there's no animal called

86
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:24,472
a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.

87
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,055
Well, neither is bigfoot Kyle,

88
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:26,813
but there are a lot of people

89
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:28,265
who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.

90
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,526
If someone says they saw a Sasquatch,

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,615
they are either lying

92
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,787
or they are stupid.

93
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:35,025
Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra

94
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:36,707
before stupid people start believing you!

95
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:42,586
Lllloooo... loooo looo...

96
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:44,921
N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra.

97
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:46,709
People made it up.

98
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:51,436
It's -- that's okay.

99
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:53,299
Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra

100
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,039
it couldn't get in my r-room anyways...

101
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:56,052
Butters.

102
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,901
Come on, Butters, you and me are

103
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:00,370
gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.

104
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:02,093
No, it's a school night!

105
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:03,098
Butters, do you know how many

106
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:04,777
times Jewpacabra has been shot on video?

107
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:05,828
Zeee-ro!

108
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,394
I can't do this alone, please...

109
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,884
Help me prove to the rest of the world
Jewpacabra is real.

110
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,600
Look at these dense trees and brush,

111
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:18,652
oh, yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest

112
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:19,881
Jewpacabra likes to hide in.

113
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:21,913
You think Jewpacabra is here?

114
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,263
I'm pretty sure Jewpacabra was here...

115
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,913
Oh good... maybe we scared it off

116
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,733
You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters.

117
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:28,838
Don't forget we're dealing with

118
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,902
a creature that drinks blood,

119
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:30,758
hides in the night and

120
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,905
has absolutely no belief
in the divinity of Christ.

121
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,118
Did you hear that?

122
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,385
I'm going to try a
Jewpacabra mating call now...

123
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:38,888
No Christ!

124
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,659
No Christ!

125
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:46,040
I'm really not buying this
whole Christ thing.

126
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:48,295
...he's here somewhere.

127
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:51,201
Oh God, I'm scared.

128
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:52,594
Jesus is a lie!

129
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:53,719
Eric, stop it!

130
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:55,220
Help me call it out Butters.

131
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:56,922
I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!

132
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:57,801
Butters, do you wanna catch

133
00:04:57,802 --> 00:04:58,959
Jewpacabra on camerar not?!

134
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,331
There is no Christ.

135
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:03,694
Jesus is a lie.

136
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,049
No way Jesus was son of God, huh Butters.

137
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,263
Nope. I don't think...

138
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:09,350
Christ has any basis in reality.

139
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,595
You hear that?!

140
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,569
Oh, hamburgers...

141
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:17,542
We started Sooper Foods to give

142
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:20,852
people a place to buy groceries
that was fun and safe.

143
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,533
We are not canceling our easter egg hunt

144
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:23,980
because of some wild story!

145
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,706
I didn't think you would believe me.

146
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,735
And that why last night I took

147
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:29,072
it upon myself to go out
and try to capture it on video.

148
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:30,320
What I'm about to show you

149
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,200
is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.

150
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:35,282
And you're the first to see it.

151
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,440
This is just after 8 p.m.

152
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:39,400
First we heard rustling in the bushes.

153
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,361
Then a strange,
animal-like scurrying sound.

154
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:43,128
That's when we saw, this.

155
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,412
Kay wait for it, wait for it,

156
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:47,813
wait for it... wait for it....

157
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:49,888
Wait for it... right there!

158
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:51,280
Did you see the Jewpacabra?!

159
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:53,216
I know, it's so shocking it

160
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,115
takes a minute for your brain to

161
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:54,946
process what it's seeing.

162
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:55,917
Watch again.

163
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,390
Wait for it... wait... there!

164
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,047
Jewpacabra.

165
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:02,474
There's a Jewpacabra in South Park...

166
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,761
God help us.

167
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:05,605
That wasn't a dog?

168
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:06,948
It was no dog.

169
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:08,879
I was there, I'n telling you-

170
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,217
this thing had no idea that

171
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:11,606
Jesus Christ had died for our sins.

172
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:12,608
What?

173
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:13,495
I can try to catch it,

174
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,200
But I'm going to need all
the resources you've got.

175
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:16,289
If this thing isn't contained,

176
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,672
your easter egg hunt is going to be
a bloodbath.

177
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,038
Mr. Billings?

178
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:25,340
There's two things that separate Sooper Foods

179
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,780
from all the other grocery stores:
Fun and safety.

180
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,936
What do you think, Peters?

181
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,241
What are the chances that

182
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:32,949
this 'Jewpacabra' is real?

183
00:06:33,162 --> 00:06:34,808
I'm estimating somewhere around...

184
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:37,149
Point zero zero zero zero zero

185
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:40,094
zero zero zero one percent.

186
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:43,203
We can't afford to take that chance...

187
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:45,442
Let's get this kid whatever he needs.

188
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:56,362
So where are we heading first?

189
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:59,360
We need to get to the city of Nassau
in the Bahamas.

190
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:00,054
Here.

191
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:00,872
The Bahamas?

192
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:01,696
That's right.

193
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:03,048
There's a resort near there

194
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,935
called 'The Atlantis hotel and casino'.

195
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:06,424
They have a water slide there

196
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,055
that goes through a shark tank.

197
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:11,244
Weeeeeeeeeee!!!!

198
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:13,891
Oh yesss!!

199
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:14,684
Oolll!!!!

200
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:16,290
Check it out!!!!!

201
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:27,559
Where to now?

202
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:29,397
Now we head back to Colorado,

203
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,312
here.

204
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:31,793
We need to get my video of

205
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:34,163
the Jewpacabra into
the hands of professionals

206
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,119
who can analyze it.

207
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:41,606
Would you stop scaring everyone

208
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:42,721
with your dumb ass myth!

209
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,776
People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle,

210
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:45,795
but I was just there.

211
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:47,322
I've explored the depths of Atlantis

212
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:49,080
and now I'm about to prove
a new species exists

213
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:50,532
I'm a little James Cameron.

214
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:52,369
These people aren't going to prove anything.

215
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:53,570
To believe any of this

216
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,734
you either have to be a liar, or stupid.

217
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:57,104
These are professional people

218
00:07:57,105 --> 00:07:59,103
who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle!

219
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:01,139
They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!

220
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:03,479
Look at its trajectory -

221
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:04,779
it heads directly to the right.

222
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,089
It can't be human it's too low to the ground.

223
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:08,448
What do you think, Bobo?

224
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,338
Bobo think scary!

225
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,908
It's definitely something.

226
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,267
I'm thinking a Sasquatch.

227
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:15,057
It's not big enough to be a Squatch.

228
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,717
So it's a baby Squatch?

229
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:17,990
That's what I'm thinking.

230
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:19,429
I've already done my research boys.

231
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:20,397
What you're looking at there

232
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,471
is a Jewpacabra.

233
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:22,675
Jewpacabra?

234
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,920
It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive,

235
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:26,655
more ferocious and a little more greedy.

236
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:29,677
Ohhh, Jewpacabra that sounds scary!

237
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:31,075
But it makes total sense.

238
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,518
If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch,

239
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,411
Jewpacabra is all we really have left.

240
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,751
Well, I guess that's it.

241
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:37,927
You're going to have to only allow me

242
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:39,237
into the easter egg hunt, sir.

243
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:40,338
I'm the only one qualified.

244
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:43,153
Aw, the kids will be so disappointed...

245
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:44,440
Whoa look at this!

246
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,085
I just did the heatie thermal thingie to the video!

247
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:49,075
It's all orangie!

248
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,277
But it's supposed to be all yellow-y.

249
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:52,286
My God!

250
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,560
This really is proof of a Jewpacabra!

251
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:57,335
What do you mean.

252
00:08:58,031 --> 00:08:59,470
We've never seen this before!

253
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:00,418
It really is true!

254
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:02,760
Well, I mean it-- could have just been a dog.

255
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:04,323
No it's impossible.

256
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:05,471
Look at the zoomy in:

257
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,784
If I drop image of a dog next to it...

258
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,063
That thing is way to big to be a dog.

259
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:12,052
And check out the thermals coming off of it.

260
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:15,098
That's the thermals -
they make a proof and the thermals!

261
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:16,237
That's right, Bobo.

262
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:18,900
Whatever this thing is
it's mean and angry as hell.

263
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:21,138
Well, come on guys,
it's probably a Jewpacabra

264
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:22,602
but this isn't definitive.

265
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:24,173
I'll tell you one thing, kid,

266
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:25,550
you're pretty braaave.

267
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:26,630
Why.

268
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,381
Cuz you took the video of this thing.

269
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,724
It's not gonna like that.

270
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:31,907
If it is a Jewpacabra...

271
00:09:32,387 --> 00:09:34,286
He's gonna be coming after you.

272
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:42,058
There's... no way...

273
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,745
No way Jewpacabra is real...

274
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:48,345
Those cryptozoologists don't

275
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:49,377
know what they're talking about.

276
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,844
They just... they just gave me

277
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:52,365
a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all...

278
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:58,861
Hey.

279
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:01,219
Jewpacabra can't be real, right?

280
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:03,017
Tell me again why it can't be real?

281
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:05,594
I mean, it's impossible that

282
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:08,299
something I made up could turn out
to actually exist, huh, Kyle?

283
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:09,956
What are you doing?

284
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,708
Okay, okay, even if there was a Jewpacabra,

285
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,460
it wouldn't know I was the one
who got video of it, huh?

286
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:16,538
How could it know that?

287
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:18,177
It couldn't know that. Right?

288
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:19,590
Kyle.

289
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,864
Jesus loves me this I know...

290
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:43,314
Cuz Republicans tell me so...

291
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:47,229
Little ones God will protect.

292
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,741
Cuz letting kids be harmed is child neglect...

293
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,307
Everything still clear out there?

294
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:57,525
Guys?!

295
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,644
It's all quiet out front, Eric.

296
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:00,903
Well, check everywhere!

297
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:03,914
I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks
to scratch your buttholes!

298
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:06,557
He says he's not payin' us to
scratch our buttholes...

299
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:12,153
What? What was that? Butters?! Token?!?!

300
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,650
Oh Jesus Christ!

301
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:16,044
You guys?!

302
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:19,701
Aghgh!

303
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:27,453
You guys?!

304
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,445
Guys!!

305
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:29,470
Hey, Eric.

306
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:30,203
It's trying to get in!

307
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:31,527
Where the hell are you guys?!

308
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:34,272
Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet.

309
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:37,016
Wingstreet?!

310
00:11:37,017 --> 00:11:39,131
Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.

311
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,532
Dude, I want wings!

312
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,757
Ahghgh!!!

313
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,736
Oh Jesus- it's only you!

314
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,076
Alright, grab him.

315
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:53,032
You say the Jewpacabra hunts
for anything easter

316
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:54,778
- and now it's looking for you...

317
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,732
Get me outta here!!

318
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:03,164
Please!!

319
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:04,671
Helllppp!!!

320
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:06,311
Look, we're sorry.

321
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:08,389
But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants,

322
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,807
we don't have a choice.

323
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:11,524
Oh God, it's gonna kill me!!!!!

324
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:17,134
What the--?!

325
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,772
Just a little blood to try and draw it out.

326
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,589
We just can't risk the creature
showing up tomorrow.

327
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,482
Our entire business is based on
fun and safety.

328
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:28,355
This isn't safe or fun!

329
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:29,746
Maybe it won't even show up.

330
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:32,194
Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay.

331
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:35,513
Oh ****, we better get out of here.

332
00:12:35,514 --> 00:12:36,302
No!

333
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:37,313
Come back!

334
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:37,890
Come back please!!!

335
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,513
This isn't right!!!

336
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:45,161
Hello young man.

337
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:46,456
Let me start off by saying

338
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:50,475
Sooper Foods is absolutely not
an anti-semitic company.

339
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,947
But... if your people do have
a monster creature

340
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:58,910
that feeds on easter children
we just wanted to let you know

341
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,916
there is a sacrifice for it in the park

342
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:03,477
that is totally fun and safe to eat.

343
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:04,717
Thank you!

344
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:20,628
Kyle!

345
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:22,070
...hey, Kyle!

346
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:28,261
I know what you're thinking, Kyle.

347
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,841
That, like, this is some kind of
fitting comeuppance.

348
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:34,814
Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.

349
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:37,409
Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle.

350
00:13:37,427 --> 00:13:38,747
There's no Jewpacabra.

351
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:40,415
Now, please, Kyle, it's easter Eve!

352
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,314
And if Jewpacabra smells this blood,
I am in a heeb o' trouble!

353
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:46,657
No Kyle! No wait!

354
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:47,621
I'm sorry I couldn't help it!!!

355
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:48,518
Kyle?!?!?

356
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,006
Please I'll give you money!!!

357
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:51,454
I have lots of money!!!

358
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:52,801
Oh God, what am I doing?!

359
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:55,466
I mean I don't have any money!

360
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,933
I'm totally broke!

361
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:59,319
Oh God- I am in a heeb of trouble...

362
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:03,929
It's so cool that...

363
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,976
Even though I'm Christian
I celebrate passover too!

364
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:08,425
Yup.

365
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:10,375
I think both holidays are awesome...

366
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:22,331
I really sympathize with those
Jews in ancient Egypt!

367
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:23,708
I really do!

368
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:31,837
What'dya think, Bobo?

369
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,834
No doubt about it!

370
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:36,291
It's a three foot tall bunny-man!

371
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,528
I told you!

372
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,759
Bunny people must be a throwback
to paleolithardic times!

373
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,215
Shoot it Bobo!

374
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,663
Bobo shoot it!

375
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:48,704
Bobo?! Bobo no!

376
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:50,732
Wha-.?

377
00:14:52,787 --> 00:14:53,548
Bobo got it!

378
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:55,503
Bobo got the bunnyman!

379
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:56,773
Good shot, Bobo!

380
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:58,064
Now what do we do?

381
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,005
I know!

382
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:01,699
Let's go get a show about it on
Animal Planet!!!

383
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,820
Good idea.

384
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:04,034
Wait wait wait wait.

385
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,246
We're gonna need to take the evidence.

386
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:07,145
All right.

387
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:08,724
I got the evidence right here.

388
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:10,875
The dart gun I shot the bunnyman with.

389
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:11,838
All right!

390
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,180
Come on, let's go!

391
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:17,186
Ugh... what... where....

392
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,048
Ugh... what...?

393
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:24,728
What's going on?!

394
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:25,550
The plagues!!

395
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,927
The plagues are upon us!!!

396
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:28,152
Run!!!!!

397
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:38,604
It's raining frogggggsss!!!

398
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:41,930
Kyle! Kyle my Hebrew friend!

399
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:43,755
Did you see that it's raining frogs?!?!

400
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:47,243
Yes. It's because the pharaoh won't give
the hebrews what we want!

401
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:48,542
God is angry.

402
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,150
So God makes it rain frogs?!

403
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:54,166
That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.

404
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,394
That's how God is!

405
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:57,070
And if pharaoh doesn't give us what we want,

406
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,977
next he's gonna kill all
Egyptian first born boys!

407
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:01,054
Okay, look,

408
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:03,311
I'll talk to the pharaoh and see
if he'll change his mind.

409
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:04,063
It doesn't matter.

410
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,419
Because God is going to harden
the pharaoh's heart!

411
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,391
What does that mean?

412
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:09,040
It means Jehovah is going to
use his powers

413
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,908
to keep the pharaoh from letting us go.

414
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,923
Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle.

415
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:15,690
I mean, if God is going to make pharaoh say no,

416
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:17,421
then why would he punish him for saying no?

417
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:18,799
That's just how God is.

418
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,035
You're wrong, Kyle!

419
00:16:20,036 --> 00:16:21,583
God is not a dick!

420
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:37,511
Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs.

421
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:40,626
It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear.

422
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:42,614
But my friend Kyle, he says that

423
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,222
the reason we've had all
these plagues and stuff is

424
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:45,956
because you won't let all the Jews leave.

425
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:49,223
It's a complicated political issue, my son.

426
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:52,184
An economic social issue that needs time.

427
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:54,849
We can't let them leave
but is it really all that different from

428
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,157
when the north didn't let
the confederate states leave the U.S.A?

429
00:16:58,211 --> 00:16:59,880
Wow, that makes sense...

430
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:01,897
Don't think anyone can deny that...

431
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:05,852
Poor frogs... I feel so bad for them...

432
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,114
But dad, my friend Kyle says

433
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,469
that if we don't do whatever
the Hebrews want us to do,

434
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,850
God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.

435
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:16,691
Hoh, I don't think God would do
such a thing, little one.

436
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:17,651
No matter what happens,

437
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:21,100
We can't let ourselves believe in
the Hebrew version of God.

438
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:25,429
We believe in a just Lord who would
never murder innocent children.

439
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:27,787
I love you, dad.

440
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:29,828
And I love you son.

441
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,773
And our love grows...

442
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:35,097
And our love grows-

443
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,049
and our love grows,

444
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,870
like the mighty river of the Nile-

445
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:44,097
river of the Nile... see it flow-

446
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:47,967
we'll never be aparrrrt...

447
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:51,610
Have no fear, for God is near,

448
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:55,232
and God loves all his children--

449
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:59,389
Nooooooooo!!!!!

450
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:03,904
Kyle, why?!

451
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:04,885
What are you doing?!

452
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:06,817
This is what God told us to do!

453
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:08,789
No, Kyle! I don't believe you!

454
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,090
You'll see!!

455
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:13,719
Nooooooo!!!!!

456
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:16,059
What's happening to us?!

457
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:19,089
Nooooo!!

458
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:20,295
Mom!

459
00:18:20,296 --> 00:18:21,759
Don't let God kill me!

460
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:24,066
No!! Nooo!!!

461
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:26,764
Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!

462
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:28,170
Nooo! The bread's all flat!

463
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,086
Noooo!!!!!

464
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,581
Noooo!!!

465
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,739
Son! We were wrong!

466
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,382
I was wrong!!!

467
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:36,844
We were wrong!!!!!

468
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:39,638
I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise!!

469
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:43,074
Please don't kill me!!
Don't kill me!!!! Noooooo!!!

470
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,047
Noooo! Noooo!!!
The bread is all flat!!! Nooooo!!!!!

471
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:11,060
Nooo... no...

472
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:46,864
There are two things people think about
when they are grocery shopping:

473
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,916
Fun and Safety.

474
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:50,846
On this beautiful easter morning,

475
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:53,557
we are thrilled to give back to
the people of South Park

476
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,348
who for the third year in a row
have made our grocery store number...

477
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:01,138
4 in fun and number 6 in safety.

478
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:02,974
Let the hunt begin.

479
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,125
I'm alive!!

480
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,190
I'm alive, you guys.

481
00:20:21,191 --> 00:20:22,095
I don't know how...

482
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,282
but I'm alive!!

483
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:25,453
Can you believe it. It's a miracle.

484
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:28,633
Listen everybody,

485
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,882
last night I almost died.

486
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:33,012
But then a pass of a miracle happened.

487
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:35,153
The Jewpacabra passed me over,

488
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:37,013
and by the power of Jehovah I somehow,

489
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,758
woke up safely in my bed.

490
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,047
I learnt a big lesson.

491
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:42,461
It's wrong, guys.

492
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:45,251
Christ didn't die for our sins
and God is angry.

493
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:48,300
It's time for us all to stop this
easter ridiculousness,

494
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:50,789
accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.

495
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:54,758
Oh, stop trying to ruin easter, You!!

496
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,055
***

497
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,077
Yeah!

498
00:20:58,078 --> 00:20:59,465
Hey guys, listen!

499
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:07,387
Huh... I finally know how you feel, Kyle.

500
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:10,436
Know your religion is right
but being laughed up by everyone else.

501
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,309
It's so hard for us Jews.

502
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,987
But I guess we just have to let stupid people
believe what they are gonna believe.

503
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:18,362
Yeah.

504
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,879
I know what you're thinking Kyle.

505
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,006
But I really do believe in Judaism now.

506
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:23,401
I'm not lying.

507
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,466
I know, you're not.

508
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,600
Kewl, thanks Kyle.

509
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,709
Oh, and Kyle...

510
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:32,463
Happy passover!

511
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:34,440
Happy passover, Cartman!

512
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:39,818
